# My Readable Project

A simple app that allows a user to view, edit, add, and delete posts and comments related to specific topics.

## Pre-requisites
This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

## Get the App
Download the app from [https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git](https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git) or clone it into a new git repository:
` git clone https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git `

In order for this app to function, you must also download and run the backend server provided by Udacity.  You can download that here: [https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git] (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git), or clone it into a new git repository:
`https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git`

## Install
First, start up the backend server by navigating to the reactnd-project-readable-starter directory and running `node server` in the console.  This by default will be listening on port 5001.

Then install and run the front end React application by navigating to the root of the project directory and executing the following commands:

```
    npm install
    npm start
```

This should automatically launch the app in your browser, but if it does not, navigate to localhost:3000 in your favorite browser.

## Key Dependencies

**react-jsonschema-form** - Used to generate forms using JSON schema.
