#My Readable Project

A simple app that allows a user to view, edit, add, and delete posts and comments related to specific topics.

##Pre-requisites
This app requires only [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

##Get the App
Download the app from [https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git](https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git) or clone it into a new git repository:
` git clone https://github.com/jacobblaylock/readable-react-redux-app.git `

##Install
Navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following commands:

```
    npm install
    npm start
```

This should automatically launch the app in your browser, but if it does not, navigate to localhost:3000 in your favorite browser.
